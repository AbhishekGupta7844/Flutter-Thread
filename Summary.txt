This repo has the flutter codes from the fourth day of my Flutter training, 

[2020-07-22] Day 4{
	Learnt to add Icon,
	Learnt to add Images,
	Learnt to add Scaffold,
	Learnt to add AppBar,
	Session was concentrated on AppBar,
	We can also remove the debug banner from app,
}

[2020-07-23] Day 5{
	Session was concentrated on Body of our application,
	Learnt about Container, Column and the difference b/w them,
	Learnt about decoration property,
	Learnt to style the border of Container,
	Conatainer allows us to use only one child property,
	Column has a list<widget> in which we can write children,
}

[2020-07-24] Day 6{
	Session was concentrated on few core concepts of Flutter,
	Learnt about Hot reloading,
	Hot reloading is the best thing for any developer,
	We need to enable hot reloading when we begin our code from scratch,
	Hot reloading refreshes the update part in the code without completely running the code again,
	This is done with the help of BuildContext and Stateless Widget,
	We will be learning more about it in future,
	Then we learnt about the concept of package (read the text file in day6 directory),
	We imported some packages to change colour of status bar and also to write a toast(toast is nothing but a popup),
	We then used these two packages to write a code and changed the colour of statusbar,
	We also wrote a code for a toast using the imported package.
}

[2020-07-27] Day 7{
	Session was concentrated on creating a custom layout,
	We used te concepts of Container and Column to create one,
	We first understood the concept of margin and padding and how they are different,
	Although we can create a container inside a container but there is no practical use case of it,
	Container can only have one child and there is no use of it,
	We can use a Column inside a Container which can then have multiple children,
	As the name suggests Column arranges the widgets in the form of column,
	We also have a property for Row and also a Stack widget which helps in overlapping of widget,
	Since there are no features of negative margins thus flutter provides us with the feature of Stack,
	Learnt about the InkWell and GestureDetector feature also and how they are different,
	Learnt few more terminologies of flutter including EdgeInsets etc,
}
