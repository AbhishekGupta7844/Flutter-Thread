[2020-07-23] Day 5{
	Session was concentrated on Body of our application,
	Learnt about Container, Column and the difference b/w them,
	Learnt about decoration property,
	Learnt to style the border of Container,
	Conatainer allows us to use only one child property,
	Column has a list<widget> in which we can write children,
}

[2020-07-24] Day 6{
	Session was concentrated on few core concepts of Flutter,
	Learnt about Hot reloading,
	Hot reloading is the best thing for any developer,
	We need to enable hot reloading when we begin our code from scratch,
	Hot reloading refreshes the update part in the code without completely running the code again,
	This is done with the help of BuildContext and Stateless Widget,
	We will be learning more about it in future,
	Then we learnt about the concept of package (read the text file in day6 directory),
	We imported some packages to change colour of status bar and also to write a toast(toast is nothing but a popup),
	We then used these two packages to write a code and changed the colour of statusbar,
	We also wrote a code for a toast using the imported package.
}
